If you find this application worthy, I have a Amazon wish list set up (www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE ).

Updated org/camden/ups/rateservice.cfc and servicecodes.xml
These updates are by Aaron Stoddard. I've used his email to me as a lazy way to handle the release notes:

So this has probably already been done but I wanted to let you know I was able to complete the Negotiated Rates Info part of your CFUPS component for UPS Package Ratings. It was actually pretty darn simple.

I am implementing your component in our intranet for our sales people to get sales quotes based on our negotiated rates with UPS. By passing in our shipper number (activated by our UPS rep with a discount) in the arguments, along with a small addition to the request XML, I was able to get the response to include the NegotiatedRates container with the discounted prices.

I added the following at the bottom of the request XML (but inside the <shipment> container):
<RateInformation>
<NegotiatedRatesIndicator></NegotiatedRatesIndicator>
</RateInformation>

By supplying UPS with this empty container, it tells the API to validate the shipper number and return the negotiated rates. The next step is simply adding the column to the query object you created and voila! Discounted rates! Note that the test server applies a discount of 1%.

Fixed an issue in addressverification.cfc where calls to street level and non-street level valdiation would cause the URLs to become screwed up.
In rateservice.cfc, you can now use a declared value for your packages.

Francisco Mancardi fixed a bug where the shipment tracking would throw an error when searching via
reference number.

Last Updated: January 5, 2007 (0.2)
Fixed a bug where a warning was being flagged as an error. These warnings are now shown
in the "responsewarning" column. There is only one unique value for this so if you need 
the value, just look at row 1. This is different from the warning column which applies
JUST to a particular service.

Initial release. No docs yet. Please note you MUST enable an application, get an XML key, and a username/password
before the test files will run. Docs will come soon.
