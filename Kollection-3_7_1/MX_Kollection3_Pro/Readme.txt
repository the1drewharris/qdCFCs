MX Kollection 3 Professional Installation procedure
------------------------------------------

1. Before installing our product please read the section allocated to this subject from the 'The_Getting_Started_book.chm' file, in order to avoid problems that might appear.

2. VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE - for Dreamweaver MX and MX 2004 users. Starting with 3.2.0 version, our products do not longer include Advanced Recordset functions. These function have been included in a separate extension named AdvRS-3_2_2.mxp located in the "For Dreamweaver MX and MX 2004 Only/" folder in this package. By consequence, users installing our products on Dreamweaver MX and MX 2004 will also HAVE to install the Advanced Recordset extension. This extra install will NOT be required for Dreamweaver 8 users. MORE DETAILS can be found at the following address: http://www.interaktonline.com/rs/

3. IMPORTANT NOTICE: MX Kollection Pro requires Dreamweaver 8.0.2 version.

4. If you want to upgrade from MX Kollection 3, please make sure you uninstall the previous version first and the prevoius MX Kollection Help

5. If you want to improve old sites created with MX Kollection 2 by adding MX Kollection 3 features please check this technote: http://www.interaktonline.com/Support/Knowledgebase/Category/Details/116/PHAkt.html

6. If you are running our product on Windows, you can install the MXKol3ProH-3_7_1.mxp that will allow you to read and browse the MX Kollection CHM documentation on your local machine.
